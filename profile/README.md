# Welcome to Weminal Labs,

We are all students from a university in Vietnam. We've had a beautiful journey learning about smart contracts, first with [NEAR](https://devfolio.co/projects/wedata-3418), then [Oraichain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/long-journey-learning-building-oraichain-hackathon-hien-phan-cfecc/?trackingId=xpzJX5DJScmjZKBP5rOwfg%3D%3D). Currently, our journey is starting with the excitement of the SUI network, promising new insights and experiences in our innovation
