## One year, One pain:  When exploring the Web3 World
Our adventure started one year ago at a university hackathon. This event teach us about the blockchain technology and the digital world. Here, we first heard the term ‚Äú smart contract‚Äù and starting our journey into blockchain.

To be honest, I‚Äôm someone who is always excited to join hackathons. My team and I have spent many hours learning, coding, and brainstorming. Finally, we have participated in the hackathon held in APAC, and achieved third place in the Near Foundation track.

That was the first time I won a significant reward in a hackathon. However, we understood that we were still young and not well-prepared to work on this project alone.  Moving forward, our desire to learn and innovate doesn't stop here. We're setting our sights on exploring more blockchain chains within the web3 landscape. Specifically, our next step is to delve into the Cosmos chain.

It's an opportunity to not only understand its complexities but also to implement our fresh, forward-thinking ideas about AI and DeFi. We believe this exploration will allow us to enhance our knowledge and skills, enabling us to contribute more to the evolving world of web3.

Nowadays, blockchain technologies are more developed and network needs are being met. More and more people are getting involved in this field. New technology, like this, always brings excitement. I've chosen this path, and despite its challenges, it's full of joy ü§© .
